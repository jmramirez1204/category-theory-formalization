# Category Theory Formalization in Agda

This repository contains a formalization of fundamental concepts in category theory using the Agda dependently-typed programming language. The goal is to provide a formal basis for studying and reasoning about categorical structures within a proof assistant framework.

## Repository Structure

- **`big-examples/`**: Contains more advanced examples that demonstrate complex applications of the formalized concepts.
- **`small-examples/`**: Includes simpler and more educational examples, suitable for beginners in category theory or Agda.

## Requirements

To work with this project, you need:

- [Agda](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.2.2/) (version compatible with the files in this repository)
- [Agda Standard Library](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib) (make sure the version matches your Agda installation)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jmramirez1204/category-theory-formalization.git
